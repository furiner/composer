## What is this project?

Composer is a program made to suit the every day purposes of osu! mappers by giving them a modern alternative to the osu!stable and osu!lazer editor built for performantly editing tasks with necessary quality of life features that make it easier to work around making maps. 

Additionally, it is built with extensibility in mind, and will have an expansive plugin API to allow developers to add their own features and subsets to the editor without needing to fiddle their way around a codebase that they don't have to try and understand unless necessary.

**Primarily**, this editor seeks to:
* provide a clean interface for mappers of any skill level to easily work around;
* provide quality of life changes and additions to make it easier to map;
* focus heavily on performance to make handling large-scale changes easier;
* have a high quality and well-documented plugin API for developers to play with;
* and vastly support the needs and wishes of the osu! community.

## Getting Started

Currently, we are in the phase of prototyping the project, so we do not have a readily available project for people to actively toy with. If you would like to contribute to the project, however; you are free to do so!
